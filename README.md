  <h1>Binary Classification using Transfer Learning with VGG16</h1>
  <p>
    In this project, we will be using transfer learning technique with VGG16 for binary classification of cat and dog images. Transfer learning is a technique in deep learning where we use pre-trained models on large datasets to quickly train a model on a new dataset with similar features. 
  </p>
  <p>
    VGG16 is a deep learning model developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, that has been trained on a large dataset of images. The model has been trained on over a million images and has been fine-tuned for image classification tasks. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We will be using the pre-trained weights of VGG16 to train our model on a smaller dataset of cat and dog images. We will be using the top layers of the model and replacing the fully connected layers with our own layers to make predictions on our dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of the model will be evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics, and we will also visualise the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance.
  </p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of deep learning and computer vision. You will also need to install the necessary packages such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find the code for this project in the accompanying Github repository, along with the dataset and instructions on how to run the code.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    By using transfer learning with VGG16, we can quickly train a model for binary classification tasks with limited data. This technique allows us to leverage the knowledge learned by pre-trained models on large datasets and apply it to our own dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project provides a starting point for further exploration of transfer learning and deep learning for image classification tasks.
